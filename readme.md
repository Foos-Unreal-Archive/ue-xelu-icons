This plugin exposes a Blueprint Library with helpers to return an icon texture (either as a soft object reference or resolved UTexture2D) matching either:

- a Key directly
- an Input name from Input Settings
- an Input Action and Mapping Context

Content folder also has a few UMG Blueprint widgets, but those are more for testing and demonstration purpose rather than being part of the core functionality of the plugin.

## Usage

Here is the list of BP Exposed methods:

Those methods use internally a Datatable whose main purpose is to define the mapping between Unreal `FKey` and the path to the matching icon textures. Row name key (first column) follows the `IconType.Key` pattern where `IconType` can be one of the following value: `Keyboard`, `PS4`, `PS5`, `XboxOne`, `XboxSeries`.

The icons datatable can be changed in Plugin Settings: `Project Settings > Plugins > Xelu Icons`

If you need to add or edit icon mappings, I recommend doing a duplicate of this Datatable (parent table row: `XeluIconsInputsMetaData`) and changing the configuration to match yours.
